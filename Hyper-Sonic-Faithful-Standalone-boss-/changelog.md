## Hyper Sonic Fiathful 2.6
-Fixed some color oversights from 2.5.

-The cyloop color for Hyper Sonic has been changed back to white again.

-Hyper Sonic's aura across each boss should be consistent now during gameplay.

-The last update broke the standard (not colorful) aura.  This update addresses it and makes it blue again as it should be.

-Eye movement has been properly restored.  This broke due to a change in eye material names back many updates ago.


## Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.5
-Initial release

-Branched off from Super/Hyper Sonic Faithful 2.5 with minimal edits.
